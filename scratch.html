	<body>This is where we would be putting in a lot of things, hopefully a js script, but then maybe also some other things.
		<h2>Here's an H2 string. CSS will change the looks of it</h2>

		<h3>H3 here just so there's something to look at</h3>

		<h1>JAVASCRIPT ELEMENTS</h1>
		<!--
		<script type="text/javascript"> 
			
				document.write("Javascript document.write() function!");
			
		</script>
				//-->
		<!-- It looks like there is little difference between
		.write and .writeln in this example. You will need to 
		ensure that any asthetic stuff is handled by the 
		HTML/CSS as opposed to assuming multiple
		document.write() calls will provide the correct spacing
		//-->

		<!-- Anything bfore this line will load before the script
			It brings up a box, but in the background you can see
			everything loaded before this. Maskes sense, pretty
			striaght forward load order. //-->
		<script language="Javascript" src="scratch.js"></script>
